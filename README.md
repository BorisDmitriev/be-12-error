# BE router

# Task

Perform the same task again with the following additional instructions.

Make sure you have a solid error handling:

-   For example, if a book does not exist, there should be a server error with status code 500.
-   If someone has selected a route that does not exist, there should be a client error with status 404.

## Old task

## Description

In this exercise task, you will learn how to use Express Router to organize shared paths and set actions for various HTTP methods. You will create a simple project with routes and implement RESTful functionality.

## What you will do

You will create an Express project and use Express Router to organize routes and set actions for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. The project will provide a simple API for managing books. You will perform the following steps:

### Task 1: Set up Express router.

Create a new Express project and set up the Express Router to organize shared paths.

### Task 2: Create GET route

Create a GET route to retrieve all existing books. Example:

-   Path: `/books`
-   Method: GET
-   Description: This route should return all existing books.

### Task 3: Create POST route

Create a POST route to add a new book. Example:

-   Path: `/books`
-   Method: POST
-   Description: This route should add a new book to the list of books.

### Task 4: Create a PUT route

Create a PUT route to update an existing book. Example:

-   Path: `/books/:id`
-   Method: PUT
-   Description: This route should update the book with the specified ID.

### Task 5: Create DELETE route

Create a DELETE route to delete an existing book. Example:

-   Path: `/books/:id`
-   Method: DELETE
-   Description: This route should delete the book with the given id.
